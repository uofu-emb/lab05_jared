# Lab 5
In this lab we measure differnt runtimes with differnt ways of delay.

## Activity 1
1. **sleep.c without busy loop** - Expected: 1.00s, Observed: 1.000008s, Drift for 1 hour: 28.8ms
1. **sleep.c with busy loop** - Expected: 1.00s, Observed 1.002492s, Drift for 1 hour: 8.971s\

1. **timer.c without busy loop** - Expected: 1.00s, Observed: 1.000008s, Drift for 1 hour: 28.8ms
1. **timer.c with busy loop** - Expected: 1.00s, Observed 1.000008s, Drift for 1 hour: 28.8ms\
